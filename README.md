## _Description_

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal. There are many different approaches to generating mazes, with various maze generation algorithms for builing them, either by hand, or automatically by computer. Also, mazes, in general, can be organized along different classification, but the project focus is on 2D mazes which means that it's always possible to display the plan on the sheet of paper and navigate it wihtout overlapping any other passages. Our project implements three algorithms in order to generate the maze : Randomized depth-first search, Randomized Kruskal's algorithm and Randomized Prim's algorithm. 

## _The purpose of the project_
> This project has been made to reveal the process of generation for different mazes. Every maze is uniquely generated, step by step, by a seed (a number that sets up a pattern for the random number generator class). Also, your maze can be customized by choosing a color from a color picker form, being able to be exported in different formats, such as JSON files or PNG.
